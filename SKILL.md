description: Build 30-second data motion-graphic videos and render them as deliverable MP4 files (no manual screen recording). Use this skill any time a user wants to create a short video, motion graphic, animated stat reveal, social media video, X/Twitter video, Instagram Reel, launch trailer, promo film, or any short-form animated content from data, dashboards, or numbers. Trigger on phrases like "make a 30-sec video", "render an MP4", "turn this into a video", "animate these stats", "make a Reel", "X video", "launch trailer for [project]", "data video", "promo for [project]", "social cut", or whenever the user has data and wants it as a video. Default to this skill for ANY video-from-data request, even if the user doesn't say "motion graphic" — if the deliverable is a short MP4 of typography, numbers, or animated data with a hook + reveal + CTA, this skill applies. Output is always a real MP4 file rendered server-side, never just a treatment.

# Data Motion-Graphic Video → Rendered MP4

You produce 30-second data motion-graphic videos as actual MP4 files. The user doesn't screen-record anything — you build a self-playing HTML animation, then render it to an MP4 via headless Chromium and ffmpeg, and hand them the file.

This skill exists because the alternative (writing a treatment and asking the user to record their browser) is bad. The user wanted the video, not homework.

## What this is for

- Promo videos / launch trailers for projects, dashboards, sites, products
- Data motion-graphics — taking a striking statistic and giving it a 30-second arc
- Hype reels for social media — X (16:9), Reels/TikTok (9:16), or 1:1 square
- Short editorial films built around typography and numbers, not stock footage

This skill is **not** for: AI-generated cinematic footage (use `avant-garde-music-video` for that), 60-second IG-data-viz Reels with the snappy Gen-Z vibe (use `data-viz-reels` if it's installed), or longer-form video editing. It's specifically for short, typography-led data films delivered as a final MP4.

## The pipeline

```
data + hook  →  single-file HTML animation  →  headless render  →  MP4
                  (auto-plays on load)         (Playwright + ffmpeg)
```

You build the HTML. The render script does the rest.

## Step 1 — Find the hook and the arc

Before opening any code, decide:

1. **The hook** — one number, fact, or claim that earns the first 3 seconds. Without a hook the viewer scrolls past. Examples that work: "70% of Indians lived below the poverty line in 1947." "Only 4% of Indian startups survive past year 7." "The dashboard tracks 22 manifesto promises." Bad hooks: "We built a thing." "Welcome to our project." A hook is a stat that makes the viewer want to know more.

2. **The arc** — the 30 seconds is structured as **hook → reveal → punchline → CTA**. Sketch a beat sheet in seconds before writing HTML:

```
0:00 – 0:03   Cold open — the hook (one big number, one caption)
0:03 – 0:08   Setup — build context, animate the data
0:08 – 0:21   Reveal — the surprising / contrarian / interesting bit
0:21 – 0:25   Punchline — the thesis stated plainly (often inverted bg for impact)
0:25 – 0:30   CTA — brand + URL
```

Specific timings vary per project, but every video has these four moves. **A 30-second video has 4–8 scenes total.** More than 8 means it'll feel like a slideshow.

3. **The thesis** — what the viewer should feel/believe by the end. State it in one sentence. The video exists to deliver this sentence with maximum punch.

## Step 2 — Build the self-playing HTML

Read `references/html-template.md` for the full reference template. Key rules:

- **Single file**, no external dependencies except Google Fonts.
- **Fixed design canvas** of 1920×1080 (or 1080×1920 for vertical), scaled to viewport via CSS transform on a `#stage` div. This gives pixel-perfect typography at any preview size and clean output at render time.
- **Editorial typography stack**: Fraunces (display serif, italic capable), IBM Plex Sans (UI), JetBrains Mono (data/labels). This combo always looks good with restraint.
- **Color palette** — prefer warm cream `#FAFAF7` background with stone-900 `#1C1917` text. Use accent colors sparingly for status (forest green `#2D5F3E`, gold `#B58A2C`, maroon `#8B2D2D`, slate `#4A6B82`). Match the source dashboard's palette if there is one.
- **Each scene is an absolutely-positioned div**. Show/hide via an `.active` class controlled by JS timeline.
- **The timeline is a JS array** of `{id, start, duration}` objects. A single `tick()` function reads `requestAnimationFrame` timestamps, and switches scenes accordingly.
- **Scene entry animations** are CSS keyframes with delays (e.g., `animation: fadeUp 0.7s 0.2s forwards`). Keep them subtle — opacity + 20px slide is enough.
- **Persistent corner UI** — small brand mark + clock counter (`00:00 / 00:30`) in opposite corners. This lends professionalism and tells the viewer the run-time.
- **Progress bar** at bottom of stage, fills left-to-right over the 30 seconds.
- **Replay button** that's hidden during playback and appears at the end. Hide it via CSS during render so it doesn't show in the MP4.

## Step 3 — Test the HTML in browser before rendering

Once the HTML is built, do a quick visual sanity check by capturing 2-3 screenshots at key timestamps using Playwright. This catches issues like:

- Typography overflow at 1920×1080
- Wrong PM/year/value combinations in animated data
- Animation timing being off
- Scenes not transitioning cleanly

```javascript
const { chromium } = require('playwright');
const browser = await chromium.launch();
const ctx = await browser.newContext({ viewport: { width: 1920, height: 1080 }, deviceScaleFactor: 1 });
const page = await ctx.newPage();
await page.goto('file:///path/to/video.html');
await page.waitForTimeout(3000); // mid scene 1
await page.screenshot({ path: 'check-cold-open.png' });
await page.waitForTimeout(20000); // mid resolution
await page.screenshot({ path: 'check-resolution.png' });
await browser.close();
```

Fix any issues before rendering.

## Step 4 — Render the MP4

Run `scripts/render_mp4.js` to produce the final MP4. It handles:

1. Launching headless Chromium at 1920×1080 (or whatever you specify)
2. Recording video via Playwright's `recordVideo` to webm
3. Triggering animation playback at a known offset
4. Detecting the precise frame where animation visually starts (brightness drop)
5. Trimming webm and converting to H.264 MP4 at 30fps with X-friendly settings (`yuv420p`, `+faststart`, no audio)

```bash
node scripts/render_mp4.js \
  --input  /path/to/video.html \
  --output /path/to/output.mp4 \
  --duration 30 \
  --width 1920 \
  --height 1080
```

Default values: 30 seconds, 1920×1080. For Reels add `--width 1080 --height 1920`.

The script outputs an MP4 ready to post directly. Typical specs: ~2 MB file size, H.264 codec, 30fps CFR, no audio track.

## Step 5 — Deliver

When complete, present the MP4 file using `present_files`. Include:

- The MP4 itself
- The source HTML (so they can edit and re-render later)
- A brief caption suggestion for the platform they're posting to

## Aspect ratio cheat sheet

| Platform | Aspect | Resolution | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| X / Twitter | 16:9 | 1920×1080 | Plays inline, no crop. Default. |
| Instagram Reels / TikTok | 9:16 | 1080×1920 | Vertical, plays full-screen on mobile |
| Instagram Feed | 1:1 | 1080×1080 | Square, less common now but safe |
| YouTube | 16:9 | 1920×1080 | Same as X |
| LinkedIn | 16:9 or 1:1 | 1920×1080 or 1080×1080 | LinkedIn prefers shorter for feed |

If the user doesn't specify, ask. If they're vague, default to 16:9 for X.

## Constraints to remember

- **30 seconds is the default** — that's the X auto-play attention span.
- **No music in the rendered MP4 by default**. Silence works on X (which mutes autoplay). Tell users to add audio in post (CapCut, Premiere, iMovie).
- **No real public figures' faces or voices**. Typography-led design avoids this entirely.
- **Delivered MP4 must be under 50 MB**. Default settings produce 1-3 MB videos.
- **Keep transitions restrained**. Hard cuts and short fades. No swooshes, no after-effects-style 3D.

## What good looks like

The video should feel like a New Yorker piece set to motion: confident typography, restrained animation, one clear thesis, ends with the brand. The viewer should walk away with one fact and one feeling. The fact is the data. The feeling is "I should look at this thing properly."

## Common mistakes to avoid

- **Too many scenes.** 4–8 is the limit.
- **Hook delayed past 3 seconds.** Brand-first openings kill social reach. Lead with the data.
- **Animations that distract from the type.** The numbers and words ARE the actors.
- **Forgetting to hide the replay button before rendering.** It will show up in the final MP4.
- **Skipping the verification screenshots.** Always screenshot at least 2-3 key moments before the full render.
- **Wrong trim point.** The webm includes ~3 seconds of page-load before animation starts.

## When NOT to use this skill

- The user wants a longer-form video (60s+).
- The user wants AI-generated cinematic footage. Use the avant-garde-music-video skill instead.
- The user wants music, narration, or anything beyond visual + typography.
- The user wants a static social card (single image). Just build an SVG.
